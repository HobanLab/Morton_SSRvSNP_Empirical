# The files and folders specified in this file are ignored by the GitHub. An brief explanation of each 
# file is provided above each one, and files are largely grouped by folders. For the most part, the scripts
# and files specified here are outdated (i.e. analyses conducted early in the project, that became obsolete
# with improved understanding over time), or are otherwise a level of detail not needed for reproducibility.

# The primary directory on the Hoban Lab Linux Server that was used to conduct these analyses is below.
# Many of the raw scripts/output files can be found there, but note that the primary documentation for these
# scripts is here (and also in the lab Project Guide/manuscript, which can be found on the lab Google Drive).

# Primary directory: /RAID1/IMLS_GCCO/Analysis/
# Reference alignment directories: /RAID1/IMLS_GCCO/Alignment

# %%% RADSEQ ANALYSES %%%
# %%% EXPLORATORY R SCRIPTS FOR PROCESSING DATASETS
# The scripts below are exploratory scripts, which were used to better undersatnd the nature and naming of the
# SNP loci generated by Stacks. These scripts were largely used to fine tune the final parameters we used (especially
# for the Stacks populations scripts)

# Script looking at the allele/loci names given to Stacks loci. This is to interpret the location of SNPs along the loci
radAnalysis/analyzingAlleleNames.R
# This script was used to fine tune the parameters of the populations Stacks processes we ran: it analyzes the "Separate"
# vs. "Together" approaches (as does the script below), as well as rare alleles filters, R values, and number of SNPs per locus.
radAnalysis/differentPopScenarios.R
# Script examining the impact of processing garden and wild samples "Together" (single genind) and "Separate"
# (two different geninds). Ultimately, we took the "Together" approach in this project 
radAnalysis/oneCatalog_multiplePops.R

# %%% PRELIMINARY SUBSET FOLDER
# This scripts in this folder were used for a preliminary exploratory analysis, to confirm certain expectations about
# our data (for instance, samples of the same population clustered more closely together than samples from different 
# poulations). We ignore these scripts in the GitHub repo, but the results of this preliminary analysis are included in
# the Project Guide
radAnalysis/preliminarySubset/ 

# %%% DE NOVO Assembly
# This R script is meant to plot the distribution of SNPs per locus in a RAD assembly. This distribution can be used to
# assess the quality of a de novo assembly.
