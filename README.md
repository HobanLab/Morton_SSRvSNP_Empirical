# Overview
This repository contains the code used in the SSR vs. SNP marker comparison project,
one of the initiatives in the GCCO group. We're looking to compare how microsatellite
and RADseq markers differ in their measurements of genetic capture of ex situ collections
of two different oak species, _Quercus boyntonii_ (Boynton oak, in Alabama) and _Quercus acerifolia_
(a red oak, section Lobatae).

Currently, this repo only contains a single script, which has many lines in it referring to the different 
software being used to analyze the RADseq data. Over time, we hope to flesh out the repo more!
